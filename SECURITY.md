## Known Security Considerations

### Local Data Storage
- Seekr stores file index data locally in SQLite databases
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- File paths and metadata are stored locally only

### File System Access
- Seekr requires file system read access to index files
- Users control which directories are indexed
- No files are modified, only read for indexing

### Electron Security
- We follow Electron security best practices
- Context isolation is enabled
- Node.js integration is disabled in renderer processes
- We regularly update Electron to the latest secure version
