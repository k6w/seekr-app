## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or yarn

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/k6w/seekr-app.git
cd seekr-app

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Building for Distribution

Seekr supports building for multiple platforms:

```bash
# Build for current platform
npm run build

# Build for specific platforms
npm run build:win     # Windows (portable .exe)
npm run build:mac     # macOS (.dmg)
npm run build:linux   # Linux (AppImage)

# Test the build process
npm run test:build

# Clean build artifacts
npm run clean
```

**Platform-specific notes:**
- **Windows**: Builds both an NSIS installer (.exe) and a portable executable
  - Installer: Full installation with Start Menu shortcuts, desktop shortcut, and uninstaller
  - Portable: Single executable that runs without installation
- **macOS**: Creates a DMG installer (unsigned, may require security settings adjustment)
- **Linux**: Generates an AppImage (portable, works on most distributions)

**CI/CD**: The project includes GitHub Actions workflows that automatically build for all platforms on push to main/master branches.
